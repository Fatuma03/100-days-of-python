# Day 09 - Secret Auction (Dictionaries) 
 
**Concepts:** dictionaries, loops, user input, finding a max value 
 
## What it does 
Collects bids as name -> amount and prints the highest bidder. 
 
## How to run 
python main.py 
 
## Notes I learned 
- Using a dict to map name -> bid 
- Getting the max value safely 
- Basic input validation (strip(), isdigit()) 
 
## Next improvements 
- Save bids to a file 
- Currency formatting for outputs
